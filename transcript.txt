~18~hello and welcome to lecture eight of ~20~this lecture series ~22~on introduction to aerospace propulsion ~24~in the last few lectures uh lectures ~26~four onwards we were discussing about ~29~some of the very fundamental aspects of ~31~thermodynamics ~33~we came across several terms that we are ~35~going to use very frequently in this ~37~course so i hope you have understood the ~39~significance of many of these terms like ~42~what is the system and what is the ~44~boundary of a system what are the ~46~different types of system like closed ~47~system open system and so on ~50~what is meant by internal energy what is ~52~enthalpy and so on so these are some of ~54~the terms that we are going to use very ~56~oftenly in in the during the rest of ~58~this course ~59~so it is very essential that you ~61~understand the significance and ~63~implications of each of these terms ~66~so ~67~in in today's lecture what we are going ~69~to discuss about is a very fundamental ~71~law of thermodynamics and that is known ~74~as the first law of thermodynamics we ~76~have already discussed about the zeroth ~78~law of thermodynamics so if you recall ~80~during one of the earlier lectures ~82~we had discussed about the zeroth law of ~84~thermodynamics and what was zeroth law ~86~of thermodynamics it was essentially ~88~stating that if two bodies are in ~90~thermal equilibrium with the third body ~92~then all these three bodies are in ~95~thermal equilibrium with each other ~97~and as we had discussed zeroth law of ~99~thermodynamics forms a very ~102~basic ~103~law of thermodynamics and ~106~because it was ~108~formulated only after the first and ~110~second laws of thermodynamics were ~112~formulated it was termed as zeroth law ~114~of thermodynamics because it is a much ~116~more fundamental law than the first and ~119~second laws of thermodynamics ~121~so after the zeroth law as ~123~i had mentioned during the first lecture ~124~we shall also be discussing about the ~126~first law of thermodynamics the second ~128~law ~129~and the third law of thermodynamics so ~131~in today's lecture what we are going to ~133~talk about is about the first law of ~135~thermodynamics applied to a closed ~138~system if you recall a closed system is ~140~one wherein you can only have ~144~energy transfer across the system ~146~boundaries and no mass transfer ~148~so we shall be discussing the ~150~application or the implication of first ~151~law of thermodynamics as applied to a ~154~closed system ~156~so let us look at what are the different ~158~topics that we are going to discuss in ~160~today's lecture so in today's lecture we ~162~are going to discuss about these ~163~following topics ~165~we shall primarily be discussing what ~167~the first law of thermodynamics applied ~170~to closed systems we shall be discussing ~172~about energy balance ~174~then we shall talk about energy change ~176~for a system ~177~then what are the different energy ~179~transfer mechanisms that are involved ~182~and then we shall formulate the first ~184~law of thermodynamics as applied for a ~186~cycle ~187~and again if you recall a cycle is one ~189~wherein the initial and final states of ~192~the system are the same ~194~subsequently we shall ~196~formulate the first law of ~197~thermodynamics for a system which is ~199~undergoing a change of state ~202~and towards the end of the lecture we ~204~shall also discuss some very interesting ~206~aspects ~207~known as ~208~perpetual motion machines of the first ~210~kind these are basically devices which ~212~have been proposed ~214~which apparently well which obviously ~217~violate the first law of thermodynamics ~219~and obvious and therefore these are ~220~devices which never worked so we shall ~222~discuss these interesting devices ~224~towards the end of the lecture ~227~now ~228~we shall start our lecture with ~230~discussion on a very ~232~important experiment which was carried ~234~out ~235~more than 200 ~236~almost 250 years ago in the 1800s in ~240~mid-1800s joule carried out ~243~a series of experiments ~245~which laid the foundations for the first ~248~law of thermodynamics and these ~250~experiments were very ~251~interesting in the sense that till the ~254~time joule carried out the experiments ~256~people considered heat to be a form of ~259~an invisible fluid ~261~which they called as caloric ~264~and caloric as people believed in those ~267~days was a fluid which ~269~is basically ~271~heat and ~273~so heat transfer ~275~takes place ~276~between a body which has a higher ~278~caloric to a body which has a lower ~280~caloric and that was known as the ~282~caloric theory of heat ~285~and so joule was not very convinced with ~288~this statement of this ~290~concept of ~291~heat being a type of invisible fluid so ~294~he decided to carry out some experiments ~296~to find out whether ~298~heat is indeed a type of fluid ~300~so what he did was in his experiments ~303~which we shall discuss in detail ~305~that ~306~in his experiments he ~309~basically ~310~transferred work across ~313~an adiabatic system ~315~and then he observed that transfer of ~317~work across the adiabatic ~319~boundaries caused an increase in ~321~temperature of the system boundaries and ~324~then after you remove the insulation ~326~what happens is whatever temperature the ~327~system had acquired will be transferred ~330~back to the surroundings in the form of ~332~heat ~333~and so ~334~using this experiment ~336~joule was able to prove that essentially ~339~heat is not any fluid which flows from ~342~one body to another but it's just a form ~344~of energy ~346~and so jules experiment forms the basis ~349~for well it laid the foundations for ~352~defining what is known as the first law ~353~of thermodynamics so if you will ~356~if you look at what joule did during ~358~1840s to 1849 ~361~he decided to investigate the ~363~equivalence of heat and work well during ~365~that time it was only considered that ~368~heat is a form of a fluid will not work ~371~well joule decided to carry out ~372~experiments which can prove that ~374~basically heat and work are just two ~377~different forms of energy transfer and ~379~therefore thermodynamically they are the ~381~same ~382~and as i ~384~already mentioned before joules ~386~experiment heat was considered to be an ~388~invisible fluid ~390~and it was known as caloric ~392~and it flows from a body of higher ~394~caloric to one which has a lower caloric ~396~value ~397~the same way as we dis as we discuss ~400~today that ~401~heat is actually a form of energy ~403~transfer which takes place from a body ~405~which has a higher temperature to a body ~407~which has a lower temperature so heat is ~409~a mode of energy interaction with ~412~between a system and its surroundings or ~414~between two systems ~416~simply by the virtue of temperature ~418~difference ~419~and so this ~421~concept of ~422~flowing of caloric from a higher body ~425~with higher caloric to one with lower ~427~calorie was known as the caloric theory ~429~of heat ~431~so in joules experiment basically ~434~it was ~435~a kind of an experiment which proved ~437~that basically heat and work are ~439~identical ~440~and they are just two different forms of ~442~energy ~444~so this is ah the basic experiment which ~448~joule carried out and ~450~it's a very simple experiment as it ~452~looked like ~453~it looks ~454~like but ~455~the ~456~important thing to remember here is that ~459~it was this experiment which basically ~461~proved that heat is not basically ~464~it's essentially not a form of ~467~fluid which flows from one body to ~469~another but it is a form of energy ~471~so let us look at what are the different ~474~constituents of this experiment ~477~the experiment consists of an adiabatic ~479~vessel as you can see here ~481~this adiabatic vessel ~483~contains ~485~a fluid it could be water or any other ~487~fluid ~489~and there is a paddle ~491~wheel which is immersed in the ~493~fluid ~495~and then this paddle ~496~wheel can be driven by ~498~a pulley ~500~on which a weight is suspended ~502~so as the weight is dropped ~505~it causes ah rotation of the parallel ~507~wheel work paddle b ~508~so across the system boundaries you can ~510~see that there is a ~512~a work transfer which is taking place ~514~if there is a work done on the system ~517~and as a result of this joule observed ~520~that there is ~521~a change in the temperature of the ~523~system ~524~from what it was originally let us say ~526~the system temperature was initially t1 ~530~and as the weight is dropped ~532~it causes the paddle wheel to rotate ~534~and as the paddle wheel rotates it's ~536~basically doing work on the system ~539~and so therefore that energy has to ~541~appear in some form of the other ~543~on the system itself so where does that ~545~energy appear ~546~well that energy appears in the form of ~548~increase in temperature of the system so ~550~the temperature of the system which was ~552~initially t1 ~554~would now become t2 let us say ~556~which is where t1 is less than t2 and ~559~this temperature was measured using the ~561~thermometer which was also immersed in ~563~the ~564~fluid ~565~so this is a very ~566~ingenious experiment which joule deviced ~570~to show that ~572~it is possible to convert work into heat ~576~and ~577~therefore ~578~heat and work thermodynamically are ~580~equivalent in the sense that both of ~583~them are just two different forms of ~585~energy transfers or energy interactions ~588~so what joule did was basically to ~591~take a certain fluid in an adiabatic ~594~vessel that is insulated ~596~and then do work on the system through a ~598~paddle wheel that is as you drop the ~600~weight ~601~basically what happens is when the ~602~weight is dropped it rotates the ~604~parallel wheel and therefore that paddle ~606~wheel does a work on on the fluid ~609~resulting in increase in temperature of ~611~the fluid ~612~now after the paddle wheel after you ~615~have done work on the system now if you ~616~remove the insulation ~618~what happens is that now the system has ~620~a temperature t1 well t2 which is ~623~greater than the ambient temperature ~625~and therefore there is a heat transfer ~626~taking place ~628~across the system boundaries because ~629~there is no more insulation now ~632~and so eventually the system will come ~634~back to its position where it was before ~637~the experiment began ~639~so now you can see that what you have ~641~basically done is a process which is ~644~cyclic in the sense that the system has ~646~returned to its initial state ~649~and this was possible by two processes ~652~one of the process is work transfer into ~655~the system or work done on the system ~658~and the second process involves heat ~660~transfer from the system ~662~and so ~664~the net change in energy of there is no ~665~change in internal energy of the system ~667~after the cycle is completed we have ~669~already discussed this ~670~that for a cyclic process the change in ~673~property is ~674~cyclic integral of a property is zero ~677~and since internal energy is a property ~679~of the system ~680~cyclic integral of internal energy ~682~should be zero ~684~and therefore for ~686~this particular system at the end of the ~688~cycle ~689~there is no change in internal energy of ~691~the system ~692~so what it means is that you have done a ~695~certain amount of work on the system ~698~which appears in the form of increase in ~700~temperature of the system now if you ~701~were to transfer ~703~that much amount of energy back to the ~705~surroundings ~706~by ~707~heat transfer then essentially there is ~709~no change in the internal energy or net ~712~change in energy of the system ~714~so therefore this means that ~716~work done on the system is now equal to ~718~the heat transfer from the system ~721~so this is what joule was trying to ~723~prove and therefore work done is ~725~basically not equal to but it is ~727~proportional to the heat transfer from ~729~the system ~730~and the constant of proportionality ~732~joule was able to find out ~734~through a series of experiments on ~736~different fluids so instead of water he ~738~then used certain some other fluid in ~741~fact he also did experiments on solids ~744~that is he generated he did work on the ~746~solid system containing a set of solid ~749~blocks ~750~and that work was done by essentially ~754~that work done on the system essentially ~756~caused friction between the different ~758~solids inside the system leading to an ~760~increase in temperature ~762~but what he found was at the end of all ~764~these different experiments that ~767~the proportionality constant ~770~between work done on the system and heat ~772~transfer from the system is the same ~775~irrespective of what material or what ~777~substance you use in the system ~780~and that proportionality constant is ~781~known as the joules constant ~784~and so that basically ah so it is after ~787~these set of experiments that ~790~the ~790~si unit of ~792~energy ~793~has been termed or has been named after ~796~joule and therefore the s i unit of ~799~energy is basically joule ~802~as a mark of respect to the person who ~804~did these very fundamental ~806~experiments ~807~which defines one of the fundamental ~809~laws of thermodynamics the ah the first ~812~law of thermodynamics ~813~so let us look at some more details ~815~about the experiments which joule ~817~carried out ~818~well in joules experiment let us assume ~820~that we had work done between states 1 ~824~and 2 and therefore the work done w ~826~subscript 1 2 ~828~is the work done on the system and you ~830~can easily measure this work ~832~because its just a paddle wheel work ~834~which is implemented by ~837~a ~838~dropping of a weight or displacement of ~839~a weight so as you displace the weight ~842~you know how much the distance the ~843~weight has moved and therefore you can ~846~determine the work done on the system ~849~and so this work done on the system ~851~manifests itself in the form of an ~854~increase in temperature ~855~from initial state t1 to ~858~state t2 so the system temperature rises ~860~from state t1 temperature t1 to ~864~temperature t2 ~865~at the end of the work done process ~868~now if you remove the insulation what ~870~happens is basically that the system ~871~comes back to its initial state ~874~by heat transfer across the system ~875~boundaries ~876~and therefore the work done is basically ~879~proportional to this heat transfer ~882~and as we have already discussed this ~884~constant of proportionality is known as ~886~the joules equivalent so joules ~888~equivalent is a constant of ~890~proportionality which relates the work ~892~done on the system to the heat transfer ~894~from the system ~895~so joule found that ~898~if you if you were to carry out an ~900~experiment of this fashion ~902~it doesn't really matter what is the ~903~fluid which is held inside the system ~905~boundaries ~906~the ~908~equivalence of work done and the heat ~910~transfer from the system is basically ~912~the joules constant of proportionality ~916~and so if you were to look at ~918~this system particular system which we ~920~are discussing ~921~we have work done between states 1 and 2 ~925~let us say the process ~928~path is shown by this particular process ~930~as shown here between states one to two ~933~and ~934~so the work done on the system is w ~936~subscript one two ~938~so joule ah ~940~showed that ~942~the work done on the system can let us ~944~say be plotted in terms of some ~946~properties x and y ~948~and at the end of this process ~951~as we discussed if you remove the ~952~insulation of the system ~955~then that causes heat transfer well it ~957~results in heat transfer ~959~from the system to the surroundings ~961~and therefore that heat transfer process ~963~is shown by this second process as shown ~965~in this process diagram from state 2 to ~968~state 1. ~969~so ~971~basically this represents a cycle ~974~where in the system initially was at ~976~state 1 ~977~the first process was work done on the ~979~system by means of the paddle wheel work ~981~which resulted in change of state from ~983~state 1 to state 2 ~985~and from state 2 ~987~by heat transfer the system comes back ~989~to its initial state ~991~so the first process of energy ~993~interaction is a work transfer process ~995~or work done process and second is a ~996~heat transfer process ~998~so ~999~what it means is that for a cyclic ~1001~process ~1002~the net work done the sum total of all ~1004~work done on the system is equal to ~1007~some constant j ~1009~times the sum total of all heat transfer ~1012~taking that has taken place during this ~1014~cycle ~1015~and this constant of proportionality is ~1017~what we had discussed as the joules ~1019~constant of ~1020~joules equivalent essentially ~1023~or we can also express the ~1025~summation in the form of a cyclic ~1027~integral which is cyclic integral of w ~1029~is equal to j times cyclic integral of q ~1032~that is for a cyclic process ~1034~it is possible to ~1036~equate the work done ~1039~and the heat transfer ~1041~through the proportionality constant ~1042~which is the joules equivalent ~1044~equivalent ratio ~1047~so as i mentioned this joules experiment ~1049~forms the ~1050~basis for ~1052~the first law of thermodynamics ~1054~so first law of thermodynamics is ~1056~essentially ~1058~the conservation of energy as as you ~1061~have perhaps aware that ~1063~there is something known as a ~1064~conservation of energy principle and ~1066~that's essentially the first law of ~1068~thermodynamics that ~1069~energy can neither be created ~1071~nor be destroyed ~1073~it can only be converted from one form ~1075~to another so this is the essence of the ~1078~first law of thermodynamics that you can ~1080~either create energy not destroyed but ~1082~you can transfer it or convert it from ~1084~one form to another ~1086~and for all adiabatic so as a result of ~1088~this ~1089~first law of thermodynamics ~1091~for all adiabatic processes between two ~1093~specified states of a closed system ~1096~the net work done will be the same ~1099~and it is ~1100~regardless of the nature of the closed ~1102~system ~1103~or the details of the process because it ~1105~is essentially an adiabatic process and ~1107~the process is between two specified ~1109~states of a closed system ~1111~and since we are discussing first law ~1113~for a closed system today we will only ~1115~talk about closed systems the next ~1117~lecture will be talking about first law ~1119~for an open system or flow processes ~1122~now so the first law of thermodynamics ~1125~is essentially stating that ~1127~energy is something which you cannot ~1129~create ~1130~and there is a net energy of the ~1132~universe which does not change and so ~1135~there can only be energy transfer ~1137~between two systems or between a system ~1139~and its surroundings and it is not ~1142~possible either to create energy ~1144~or destroy energy and we shall see ~1147~towards the end of the lecture that ~1148~there are some devices which people have ~1150~proposed ~1152~which essentially violate the first law ~1154~of thermodynamics because they either ~1156~create energy in some form or ~1158~destroy energy in some form and ~1160~therefore these devices violate a ~1162~fundamental law of nature and therefore ~1164~these devices are infeasible and it is ~1166~for this reason that ~1168~such devices have never been ~1170~demonstrated though there are numerous ~1171~examples of devices which have been ~1174~proposed they have never been ~1175~demonstrated because they violate a very ~1178~fundamental law of nature ~1180~now let us look at ~1182~how we can understand the first law of ~1184~thermodynamics in little more detail so ~1186~there is a simple example given here ~1190~so this example is about ~1193~change of energy from one form to ~1195~another ~1196~so here what you see is a cliff ~1198~at the end of which we place a rock ~1200~which has a certain mass m ~1203~and by virtue of the height of this ~1206~rock above the date the baseline of the ~1209~datum ~1210~it has a certain potential energy ~1212~let us say it is 12 kilo joules ~1215~and because the rock is at rest its ~1218~kinetic energy is zero so remember we ~1220~are looking at the macroscopic forms of ~1222~energy ~1223~so the potential energy of this ~1225~particular mass is let us say 12 ~1227~kilojoules its kinetic energy is zero ~1229~because its at rest ~1231~now if you drop this rock from this from ~1233~the top of from the edge of this cliff ~1236~as the rock falls down ~1238~there is a change in its energy ~1241~so you know that potential energy is a ~1243~function of the ~1244~the height of the particular system from ~1246~the datum so as the rock falls down ~1250~potential energy decreases because the ~1252~height of the rock with reference to the ~1254~datum is reducing ~1256~so its potential energy reduces and it ~1259~becomes let us say 8 joules at this ~1261~instant ~1262~and now because the rock has a certain ~1264~velocity it also has a certain kinetic ~1267~energy ~1268~but the sum total of ~1270~potential energy plus the kinetic energy ~1272~will still be equal to what it was ~1274~originally that was 12 kilojoules and ~1277~therefore in even as it is falling the ~1280~net change or net energy of the system ~1282~will still be the same as it was earlier ~1284~that is 12 kilojoules now you may wonder ~1287~what happens after the rock has reached ~1289~the datum ~1290~after the rock reaches its bottom ~1293~then potential energy should become zero ~1295~kinetic energy also becomes zero so you ~1298~may wonder that you have actually ~1299~destroyed energy where has that energy ~1301~gone well there is no destruction of ~1303~energy here ~1304~what happens is after the rock falls on ~1306~the ground whatever energy was contained ~1309~with the rock at the initial state that ~1311~was 12 kilojoules gets converted to heat ~1314~and work that is that much energy gets ~1316~dissipated in the form of heat ~1318~and sound ~1320~so you know that as the rock falls down ~1323~you would hear a sound so that where ~1325~does that sound energy come from sound ~1327~is also a form of energy and that is ~1329~basically the energy which ~1331~the system had initially that was let us ~1333~say 12 kilo joules in this case gets ~1335~converted to sound and there is also ~1337~some amount of heat which is generated ~1340~as the rock falls on the ground ~1342~so this is just a very simple example of ~1346~how you can use first law of ~1347~thermodynamics for any system ~1349~so as you can see in this case that you ~1352~are not neither creating energy nor is ~1355~energy destroyed it is only converted ~1357~from one form to another and in this ~1360~case it was converted from potential ~1362~energy to kinetic energy and finally it ~1364~got dissipated in the form of ~1367~heat and sound so there is only ~1370~conversion of energy taking place ~1371~between different forms there is neither ~1374~creation nor destruction of energy ~1377~so the first law of thermodynamics is ~1379~what ah explains ~1381~ah this kind of energy interaction ~1383~between a system and the surroundings ~1385~let us look at some more examples and so ~1388~we have some examples here which ~1391~describe ~1392~application of first law to different ~1394~types of systems ~1395~so the first example we have let us let ~1397~us take an example of a potato which we ~1399~are trying to to boil or to cook ~1403~so we place the pot if you place the ~1404~potato in a in an oven ~1407~you know that there is heat transferred ~1409~into the potato which is why it gets ~1411~cooked ~1412~so the increase in energy of the potato ~1415~in this example is equal ~1417~to the amount of heat that is ~1418~transferred to the system that is the ~1420~potato in this case so if you were to ~1422~transfer let us say 10 kilojoules of ~1424~heat ~1425~onto the potato ~1427~the energy of the system that is potato ~1429~increases by the same amount that is 10 ~1431~kilojoules so there is no work ~1433~interaction here there is just a heat ~1435~interaction taking place between the ~1437~system and the surroundings ~1440~and and in the absence of any work ~1442~interaction while the net change in ~1444~energy of the system will be equal to ~1446~the net heat transfer ~1448~on the right hand side you can see ~1449~another example ~1451~of another system ~1452~wherein there is heat transfer into the ~1454~system as well as a heat transfer out of ~1457~the system ~1459~let us say we are transferring 25 ~1461~kilojoules of heat into the system ~1463~that ~1465~causes and change in net energy of the ~1467~system ~1468~and there is also heat transfer out of ~1470~the system and let us say in this ~1472~example it is 5 kilojoules ~1475~25 kilojoules is the heat transfer into ~1477~the system 5 kilo joule is the heat ~1479~transfer from the system ~1481~therefore ~1482~the net change in energy of the system ~1484~which is delta e is equal to q net ~1487~should be equal to qn minus q out which ~1489~is 20 kilo joules ~1491~so in the absence of any work ~1492~interaction there is no work interaction ~1494~here ~1495~the energy change of this particular ~1497~system is equal to ~1498~the net heat transfer that is heat ~1500~transfer in minus heat transfer out ~1503~so ~1505~in in this example we have seen that if ~1507~you look at a system where ~1509~there is heat transfer into the system ~1511~as well as heat transfer from the system ~1513~and if there are no work interactions we ~1515~shall look at work interactions in the ~1516~next next example ~1518~the net change in energy of the system ~1519~will just be equal to ~1521~heat the difference of the heat transfer ~1523~in and heat transfer out of the system ~1526~so this is again a consequence of the ~1528~first law of thermodynamics applied for ~1530~closed systems ~1532~now um ~1533~we will now look at some examples where ~1535~there is also work transfer into the ~1536~system across the system boundaries ~1538~and ~1539~one of the examples we shall look at is ~1541~electrical work done on the system we ~1543~have seen in the previous lecture ~1545~that there are different forms of work ~1547~done ~1548~one such form is electrical work which ~1550~involves heating of a resistor ~1553~and that causes ~1554~work done across the system boundaries ~1556~in the form of ~1558~heating of the resistor ~1560~so if you consider a system ~1562~let us say which is adiabatic which ~1563~means there is no more heat transfer ~1565~across the system boundaries but you can ~1568~still have work transfer across the ~1569~system boundaries by means of in one ~1572~example we shall look at ~1574~a resistor so if you have a resistor ~1577~inside a system ~1578~which is adiabatic or which is insulated ~1581~therefore there is no heat transfer from ~1583~the system boundaries ~1584~now you are able to do work across the ~1586~system boundaries using two modes uh one ~1590~is ~1590~electrical resistance another example we ~1592~will see is ~1594~shaft work or paddle will work ~1596~so ah in this example in the left hand ~1599~side you can see the first one that is ~1600~electrical ~1602~heating of the system ~1603~so using a battery if you were to heat a ~1605~resistor ~1607~then the net change in work done on the ~1610~system will be essentially reflected in ~1612~the form of ~1614~increase in energy of the system so let ~1617~us say in this case w in was 10 ~1619~kilojoules that will ~1621~be seen in the form of ~1624~increase in energy of the system by the ~1626~same amount that is 10 kilojoules if the ~1628~system is adiabatic ~1630~on the right hand side we have a similar ~1633~example but instead of electrical work ~1635~we have paddle wheel work ~1638~wherein you rotate a paddle wheel um ~1641~using some work and so in this case ~1643~again if the work input was 10 kilo ~1645~joules ~1646~that will ~1647~result in an increase in energy of the ~1649~system by the same amount of 10 kilo ~1651~joules ~1652~and this is again applicable as long as ~1654~the system is adiabatic so if it is not ~1656~adiabatic one also needs to consider the ~1659~heat transfer from the system boundaries ~1661~so there is heat well the example we ~1664~shall see in the next ~1665~few slides will be ~1667~systems which have both heat and work ~1669~interactions and then we will see what ~1671~is the net change in energy of the ~1673~system ~1674~and so we shall apply first law of ~1677~thermodynamics to two ~1679~well different types of systems one is ~1682~if it is a cyclic process ~1683~which we have already seen some hint ~1686~through the joules experiment wherein he ~1688~proved that the net work done on a ~1690~system is equal to ~1692~ah is proportional to the net heat ~1694~transfer ~1695~for cyclic processes well that is ~1696~essentially first law for a cycle we ~1698~will see that in little more detail ~1700~little later we will apply again first ~1702~law of thermodynamics for system which ~1704~is undergoing only a change of state but ~1706~not a cyclic process then also the first ~1709~law of thermodynamics for isolated ~1710~system so we will see that as we ~1713~progress in the in this lecture ~1716~now let us look at how you can carry out ~1718~an energy balance ~1720~for any particular system which is ~1721~undergoing some energy interaction with ~1724~its surroundings ~1727~so the net change which could be either ~1729~increase or decrease in total energy of ~1731~a system ~1732~during a process ~1734~is equal to the difference between the ~1736~total energy entering the system ~1738~and total energy leaving the system ~1741~in other words ~1742~total energy entering the system minus ~1744~total energy leaving the system is equal ~1747~to change in total energy of the system ~1750~this again is obviously a consequence of ~1752~the first law of thermodynamics ~1754~that is ~1757~ah that is e in ~1760~a minus e out is equal to delta e system ~1763~that is e in refers to the total energy ~1765~entering the system ~1767~e out is the total energy leaving the ~1769~system ~1770~delta e is the net change in energy so ~1772~if you were to consider energy per unit ~1774~mass this would be ~1776~total energy by mass ~1778~for each of them that would be small ~1780~e in minus small e out is equal to delta ~1783~smalley system ~1787~now ah so energy change is basically ~1789~energy at the final state minus energy ~1792~at the initial state now we have already ~1794~seen this that in the absence of any ~1796~electrical magnetic or surface tension ~1799~effects ~1800~the net change in energy delta e is ~1802~actually equal to delta u ~1804~plus delta k e plus delta p e where ~1808~delta k e is kinetic energy change ~1811~delta p e is the potential energy change ~1814~delta u is the ~1816~internal energy change ~1818~and therefore for stationary systems ~1821~the net change in energy of a system ~1823~will be equal to the net change in ~1826~internal energy of the system ~1829~now to explain this further if you look ~1832~at a system which has both heat ~1834~interaction as well as work interaction ~1836~across the system boundaries ~1838~so we have an example here of system ~1840~which is no longer adiabatic ~1842~and also there is work done across ~1844~system boundaries ~1847~so let us see what is the net change in ~1849~this energy of this particular system so ~1852~here there is a system where there is ~1853~some heat transfer into the system ~1856~there is some heat transfer out of the ~1857~system and there is a work done on the ~1860~system ~1861~so how do you calculate the net change ~1863~in energy of a system so you know that ~1866~if there were no work done on the system ~1868~then delta e would have simply been ~1870~equal to qn ~1872~minus q out so that is 25 minus 5 20 ~1876~kilojoules but in addition to this you ~1879~also have a work done on the system ~1880~which is 8 kilo joules here ~1882~therefore the net change in energy of ~1885~this particular system is equal to q in ~1888~minus q r plus w in ~1890~which is 25 minus 5 which is ~1892~corresponding to net heat transfer ~1895~plus 8 which is work done therefore the ~1899~net change in energy of this particular ~1901~system is 28 kilojoules therefore this ~1905~is an example which shows that you can ~1907~calculate the net change in energy of a ~1908~particular ~1910~system which has both heat interaction ~1912~as well as work interaction across the ~1914~system boundaries ~1915~by um looking at what is the net work ~1918~done on the system and what is the net ~1921~heat transfer across the system ~1922~boundaries so that will determine what ~1925~is the net change in energy of this ~1927~particular system ~1929~and so ~1931~what we shall see next is that what are ~1933~the different modes of energy transfer ~1936~i think we already discussed that ~1938~energy interaction for a closed system ~1940~can take place only in two modes ~1942~one is heat and the other is work that ~1945~is you can transfer energy across the ~1946~system boundaries ~1949~if it is a closed system it can be done ~1951~only in two modes that is heat and work ~1953~now what is what if the system also has ~1958~well if it is an open system ~1960~so in addition to heat and work transfer ~1962~for an open system it is also possible ~1965~to have energy transfer through mass ~1967~flow ~1969~so if this were the case which we will ~1971~discuss in much detail in the next ~1973~lecture that is energy transfer for open ~1975~systems ~1976~so energy transfer in in general will be ~1980~equal to ~1981~e in minus e out that is net change in ~1983~energy ~1984~is equal to net heat transfer which is q ~1987~in minus q out plus network that is w n ~1991~minus w out work done on the system ~1994~minus work done by the system ~1996~plus ~1997~the energy due to mass flow so it could ~1999~be e mass in minus e mass out ~2002~this will be equal to net change in ~2004~energy of a system ~2006~now now that we are dealing only with ~2008~closed system ~2009~this particular term will be zero there ~2011~is no mass flow across the system at ~2013~boundaries there is only heat transfer ~2015~therefore delta e system as we have seen ~2017~in the previous slide should be equal to ~2019~just delta q ~2021~and delta w ~2026~and so if you were to express the ~2028~previous ~2029~expression ~2030~e in minus e out which could be net ~2032~energy transfer it could be by either ~2034~heat work or if it is an open system by ~2038~mass ~2038~is equal to delta e of the system ~2041~which could essentially be reflected in ~2044~terms of change in internal energy ~2046~kinetic energy potential energy etcetera ~2049~and we can also express this in in the ~2052~form of rate that is in the rate form ~2054~that is rate of net energy transfer by ~2056~heat work or mass ~2058~e in which is ah there is also usually ~2062~rates are expressed by a dot ~2065~at the top of the ~2066~symbol ~2067~so e in dot means rate of energy in ~2070~minus e out dot which means rate of ~2073~energy out ~2074~is equal to d e system by dt that is ~2076~rate of change of um internal kinetic ~2079~potential energy etcetera ~2082~and so uh for if the rates were constant ~2085~then the net ~2086~heat transfer or work done or energy can ~2089~simply be found by multiplying the rate ~2092~by the corresponding time interval that ~2094~is q will be equal to q dot times delta ~2096~t w should be equal to w dot times delta ~2100~t and delta e is equal to d by dt times ~2104~delta t so this is how you find the ~2106~network ~2108~or heat or energy if you know the rates ~2110~and the time interval during which these ~2112~interactions were taking place ~2117~so what we shall look at next is how do ~2119~you apply the first law of ~2120~thermodynamics for a cycle ~2123~and we were discussing about joules ~2125~experiment which was essentially ~2128~a cyclic process wherein ah work was ~2131~done on the system and then subsequently ~2133~heat was transferred from the system ~2135~causing the system to come back to its ~2137~initial state and therefore that ~2139~qualifies as a cyclic process ~2141~and so joule had proved that for such ~2144~processes delta w is proportional to ~2147~delta q so that's essentially what ~2150~a cyclic process first first law for a ~2152~cyclic process means ~2154~so if you look at a closed system which ~2156~is undergoing a cycle ~2158~the initial and the final states are the ~2160~same right if we are already aware that ~2163~for a cyclic process the cyclic integral ~2166~of a property should be zero which means ~2168~since in energies is a property of a ~2170~system ah cyclic integral of that should ~2173~be zero ~2174~so ~2175~e in ah well e one and e two if we were ~2178~to look consider that as the initial and ~2180~final states they should be same ~2183~therefore ~2184~delta e of a system will be equal to ~2187~e 2 minus e 1 ~2189~which is essentially 0 because e 2 and e ~2191~1 are same ~2193~as the system has come back to its ~2194~initial state after the process ~2197~so delta e of a of a cyclic process will ~2200~be equal to zero so if delta e were zero ~2203~for a closed system if you apply ~2206~ah the first law of thermodynamics what ~2208~we shall see is ~2210~delta w ~2212~and delta q will be the same because ~2214~delta e is equal to zero so that is what ~2217~is explained in this slide here ~2220~now ah closed system which is undergoing ~2222~a cycle ~2223~we know that initial and final states ~2225~are identical ~2229~therefore delta e of the system ~2231~is equal to e two minus e one which is ~2234~zero ~2235~so for energy balance it simplifies that ~2239~e in minus e out is zero or it means ~2242~that e in is equal to e out so energy in ~2246~and energy out are the same ~2249~so we if we extend ~2251~the first law of thermodynamics then if ~2253~it is a closed system which does not ~2255~obviously involve any mass flow across ~2257~the system boundaries ~2258~the energy balance for the cyclic ~2260~process can simply be expressed in terms ~2262~of heat and work interactions ~2264~that is w net out ~2266~is equal to q net in ~2269~or in the form of rate w net out dot is ~2272~equal to q net in dot that is rate of ~2275~work output should be equal to rate of ~2278~heat transfer input ~2280~and so ~2281~this is basically the first law of ~2283~thermodynamics as applied to a cycle ah ~2285~well this just explained in terms of an ~2288~illustration here ~2290~we have here a cyclic process ~2292~which means that the system ah let us ~2295~say was initially at a state here at the ~2297~end of the process it comes back to its ~2299~initial state so as per the first law ~2302~delta ~2303~since delta e is equal to 0 for a cyclic ~2306~process ~2307~the net heat transfer during this cyclic ~2309~process should be equal to the net work ~2312~done during the cyclic process so this ~2314~is the first law as applied to a cycle ~2317~that ~2318~w net is equal to q net ~2321~we shall now look at ~2323~how you can calculate or determine or ~2326~apply the first law of thermodynamics ~2327~for ~2328~system which is undergoing a change of ~2330~state which means that it is not ~2332~undergoing a cyclic process but it is ~2334~just undergoing a process ~2336~wherein there is a change of state ~2338~therefore the initial and final states ~2340~will be different ~2341~so in this process obviously e delta e ~2344~will not be zero ~2346~because there is a change of state of ~2347~the system ~2349~and so we shall see what ~2351~or how we can apply the first law for a ~2353~system which is undergoing a change of ~2354~state ~2355~so in processes which involve a change ~2358~of state ~2359~you could have ~2361~a scenario where ~2363~the ~2364~heat and work interactions are unknown ~2366~that you do not know whether heat is ~2367~transferred to the system or from the ~2369~system ~2370~or work is done by the system or to the ~2372~system so normally what we do is to ~2374~assume the direction of heat and work ~2376~interactions ~2378~so the normal practice is that we ~2380~usually assume ~2381~that heat is transferred into the system ~2384~or usually there is heat input from the ~2386~cyst into the system ~2388~and there is work output from the system ~2392~so this is just a normal practice it is ~2394~not a compulsory that all systems will ~2397~definitely have such a ~2399~property there could be systems ~2401~where there is heat transfer or heat ~2403~output and there is work input but in ~2405~general it is a normal practice to ~2406~assume that heat is transferred into the ~2408~system ~2409~let us say in the amount q ~2411~and work is done by the system ~2414~by amount w ~2416~so if that were the case ~2418~then if you apply the first law of ~2421~thermodynamics ~2422~we get q net in because heat is ~2425~transferred into the system minus w net ~2427~out work done by the system ~2429~is equal to delta e of the system or in ~2431~other words ~2432~q minus w is equal to delta e ~2437~now here q ah ~2439~essentially is q net in which means q in ~2442~minus q out which corresponds to the net ~2444~heat input ~2446~and w is the w net ~2448~out which is w out minus w in that is ~2452~the net work output of the system ~2454~now if in a particular example ~2457~or in some problem which you are trying ~2458~to solve ~2460~if you apply this particular sign ~2462~convention and end up getting negative ~2464~quantity of q or w ~2466~it just means that the assumed direction ~2469~for that quantity was not correct and it ~2471~has to be reversed ~2472~magnitudes would not change just that ~2474~you may get a negative sign when you try ~2476~to solve a problem but that only means ~2479~that the assumption was initially ~2480~incorrect and it should be just reversed ~2484~so for a system which is undergoing a ~2486~change of state ~2489~the first law of thermodynamics comes to ~2492~q minus w is delta e that is net ~2495~difference between ~2496~the net heat transfer and the net work ~2499~done ~2500~will manifest itself as the net ~2503~energy change of the system that is q ~2506~minus w will be equal to delta e so ~2510~so basically first law of thermodynamics ~2513~boils down to ~2516~q minus w is equal to delta e which ~2519~means that the net heat transfer ~2523~and the difference between the net heat ~2525~transfer and the network output ~2527~will be equal to uh or will will will be ~2530~showing up as the net energy of the ~2533~system so that is basically what q minus ~2535~w is equal to delta e means ~2538~ah and so that is the first law of ~2540~thermodynamics as applied to a system ~2542~which is undergoing a change of state ~2545~and if you look at a system which has ~2548~multiple inputs and multiple outputs in ~2551~the sense that there are multiple modes ~2553~of heat transfer and multiple forms of ~2556~work interactions ~2558~then let us look at what ~2560~would be the first law for a system and ~2562~remember you can actually sum up ~2564~the ~2565~net heat transfers and net work outputs ~2568~and therefore get the delta e ~2571~now on the left hand side is a system ~2573~which is simply undergoing a change of ~2575~state there is some heat transfer into ~2577~the system and the system does some work ~2579~out ~2580~therefore the first law states that q ~2582~minus w will be equal to delta e of the ~2585~system ~2586~now what if you had multiple number of q ~2589~and ~2590~multiple number of w that is there are ~2592~multiple modes of ~2594~heat transfers either to the system or ~2596~from the system ~2598~and if there are multiple modes of ~2600~either work done on the system ~2602~or by the system ~2604~then it's ~2605~basically adding up all these quantities ~2608~so in in this case we have ~2610~heat transfer in the form of q1 to the ~2613~system q2 to the system ~2615~and q3 from the system there is so q3 is ~2618~heat transfer from the system ~2620~similarly ~2621~we have ~2622~w1 which is work done by the system ~2625~w2 is work done on the system ~2628~w3 is work done again by the system w4 ~2631~is also work done by the system ~2633~so if you were to apply the sign ~2634~conventions which we had discussed in ~2636~the last lecture ~2639~then ah heat transfer to the system ~2642~is usually taken as positive and heat ~2644~transfer from the system is negative ~2646~similarly work done by the system is ~2648~positive work done on the system is ~2650~negative so if you apply that particular ~2652~sign convention ~2653~you get q1 plus q2 because both of these ~2656~are heat transfer to the system ~2658~minus q3 because q3 is heat transfer ~2661~from the system ~2663~minus ~2664~w 1 ~2666~which is work done by the system and ~2667~therefore positive minus w 2 which is ~2670~work done on the system and hence ~2671~negative ~2672~w 3 and w 4 are positive because they ~2675~are work done by the system ~2677~so this net effect is equal to delta e ~2681~so here we have net heat transfer and ~2683~net work done is equal to net change in ~2685~energy of the system ~2687~so this is how you would apply first law ~2689~for a system which has multiple ~2691~energy interactions ~2694~so let us summarize first law for ~2696~different ~2698~first law expressed in different forms ~2699~or different ways for closed systems ~2702~so we have seen that in general you can ~2705~express ~2706~q minus w as delta e ~2709~for a stationary system because delta ~2711~kinetic energy delta potential energy is ~2713~0 q minus w is delta u ~2716~per unit mass it becomes q minus w small ~2719~letters is equal to delta e small ~2722~and in differential form ~2724~delta q minus delta w is equal to d e so ~2728~this is how you would express a first ~2730~law in general for closed systems and if ~2733~it is a cyclic process the right hand ~2734~side naturally becomes zero because ~2737~there is no net change in energy of the ~2739~system and therefore that right hand ~2740~side becomes zero ~2742~and therefore q will become equal to w ~2745~for ah cyclic processes for closed ~2748~systems ~2751~and what if the system is isolated so ~2754~for an isolated system because there is ~2756~no interaction between the system and ~2758~its surroundings there is absolutely no ~2760~energy interaction between the system ~2762~and the surroundings ~2763~delta q is zero because there is its ~2765~adiabatic delta w is also equal to zero ~2767~because it is isolated ~2769~and therefore first law gives d e should ~2771~be equal to zero ~2773~or e should be equal to constant ~2777~that means ~2779~the energy of an isolated system is ~2781~always constant ~2783~so if a system is isolated that means ~2785~that it has no energy interaction ~2787~between the system and the surroundings ~2789~the net energy of the system is the same ~2791~or the energy of the system does not ~2792~change because there is no way in which ~2794~the system can interact with the ~2796~surroundings and since it cannot ~2798~interact with the surroundings it cannot ~2799~interact or can there cannot be any ~2801~energy interaction and therefore as per ~2804~the first law energy should of that ~2805~particular system will be a constant ~2807~therefore energy of an isolated system ~2810~is always a constant ~2813~now there are some interesting ~2814~observations based on the first law ~2816~now first law is something which you ~2818~cannot mathematically prove ~2820~but just that there are no processes in ~2822~nature which have known to violated to ~2825~have violated the first law ~2827~therefore we consider that that is a ~2829~sufficient proof in itself that first ~2831~law ~2833~cannot be violated because there have ~2835~not been any proof of ~2837~violations of the first law of ~2839~thermodynamics and so therefore it is ~2841~not necessary to prove ~2843~ah first law mathematically because the ~2845~fact that there are no processes which ~2847~can actually violate first law itself is ~2849~a proof in it that first law ~2851~does exist and it is a fundamental law ~2854~and first law of thermodynamics is a ~2856~very fundamental law physical law in ~2857~itself ~2859~and first law the fact that first law ~2863~is something which you cannot ~2864~mathematically prove ~2866~or that it cannot be derived from any ~2868~other law ~2870~qualifies first law to be what is known ~2872~as a fundamental law of nature like ~2875~newton's law of nature you cannot really ~2877~prove newton's law from some other law ~2879~therefore that is why newton's laws are ~2881~fundamental laws of nature similarly ~2883~first law of thermodynamics is also a ~2885~fundamental of nature ~2888~now in as per first law of ~2890~thermodynamics we have seen that as per ~2891~first law ~2893~heat and work interactions are identical ~2895~first law does not distinguish between ~2897~heat and work it does it only considers ~2900~heat and work as two different forms of ~2902~energy interaction but what we shall see ~2904~later on ~2905~in few lectures from now is that as per ~2907~second law there is definitely a great ~2910~difference between heat and work and ~2912~that will become clear as we understand ~2915~the second law of thermodynamics but as ~2917~per first law ~2918~there is absolutely no difference ~2919~between heat and work they are simply ~2921~two different forms of energy ~2923~interactions ~2925~and ~2926~what we shall see now are some in ~2928~some interesting aspect of ~2931~thermodynamics first law of ~2932~thermodynamics that as we have seen its ~2934~a fundamental law and you cannot really ~2936~violate the first law of thermodynamics ~2939~but over the years there have been ~2941~several such concepts or proposals by ~2944~different so called inventors who have ~2946~come up with device such which basically ~2949~violate the first law of thermodynamics ~2951~and therefore ~2953~no such device has actually been proved ~2956~to be working and because if they are ~2958~actually working they would be violating ~2960~the first law of thermodynamics ~2962~and but there are so many such devices ~2964~which have been proposed over the years ~2966~and ~2967~so many inventors have kind of filed ~2969~patents for their so called inventions ~2972~which basically violate a fundamental ~2974~law of nature ~2976~and so those devices which violate the ~2978~first law of thermodynamics are known as ~2980~perpetual motion machines of the first ~2982~kind ~2983~so any device which will violate the ~2985~first law of thermodynamics is known as ~2987~the ~2988~are known as perpetual motion machines ~2990~of the first kind ~2992~and such a device obviously will create ~2994~energy and therefore ~2996~such devices cannot exist ~2999~and therefore these devices were never ~3001~actually demonstrated these were just ~3003~concepts which were proposed but they ~3005~were never demonstrated ~3007~let us look at one interesting example ~3009~here ~3010~now here we have an example where ah we ~3013~are the inventor so called inventor ~3015~proposes that ~3017~we have here a power generating unit ~3020~where instead of a boiler in a ~3021~conventional boiler where you add fuel ~3023~and generate energy here the inventor ~3026~claims that you can use a resistance ~3028~heater by using part of the power which ~3030~is generated by the generator ~3032~to generate to heat up water to generate ~3035~steam which can be expanded in a turbine ~3038~and this turbine drives both the pump as ~3040~well as the generator ~3043~and the exhaust from the turbine goes ~3044~through a condenser which condenses ~3046~water and then is pumped into the boiler ~3048~back ~3050~so there is you can see con from the ~3051~condenser there is heat transfer out of ~3053~the system and this is the system ~3054~boundary ~3056~and obviously the generator generates ~3058~electrical work output ~3061~so though this device so the inventor ~3063~claimed that once you start this device ~3065~that it can run forever without having ~3066~to use any fuel so it looks like a very ~3069~interesting innovative concept which ~3071~will solve the energy crisis forever ~3073~because you don't need any fuel to run ~3075~such a system ~3076~but if if you look at it from the ~3078~fundamental thermodynamics point of view ~3080~it violates the first law of ~3082~thermodynamics and why does it violate ~3084~it violates because it generates a ~3086~network output which is skewed out out ~3089~and w net out without any energy input ~3093~so there is no energy input into the ~3094~system but it always generates work ~3097~output and therefore it is obviously ~3099~violating the first law of ~3100~thermodynamics and such a device can ~3102~never exist and can never work which is ~3105~the reason why such a concept has never ~3107~been proven though they were proposals ~3110~and so called inventions but they have ~3112~never been demonstrated ~3115~so ah ~3117~such devices are known as perpetual ~3119~motion machines of the first kind or ~3120~pmm1 there are also devices which are ~3123~converse of pmm1 that is those devices ~3126~which will consume work output without ~3129~any heat transfer from the system so ~3132~such devices are known as converts of ~3134~pm1 but essentially they are also ~3135~perpetual motion machines of the first ~3138~kind ~3139~so let me quickly recap what we had ~3141~looked at in this lecture ~3143~we had discussed the first law of ~3145~thermodynamics for closed systems we ~3147~discussed about energy balance and ~3149~energy change of a system and also the ~3151~energy transfer mechanisms for ~3154~a system in general ~3157~then we applied the first law of ~3158~thermodynamics for a cycle ~3160~and then first law for us of a system ~3162~undergoing a change of state ~3164~towards the end of the lecture we ~3166~discussed about the perpetual motion ~3168~machines of the first kind which are ~3169~devices ~3170~which basically violate the first law of ~3172~thermodynamics ~3174~and in the next lecture what we shall ~3176~discuss is first law of thermodynamics ~3178~applied for open systems or flow ~3180~processes ~3182~and we shall ah discuss about flow work ~3185~and energy of a flowing fluid and the ~3187~total energy associated with the flowing ~3189~fluid ~3190~and how is energy transferred or ~3192~transported through mass ~3195~we shall then carry out energy analysis ~3196~for study flow systems or steady flow ~3199~processes or it is also known as steady ~3201~flow energy equation ~3203~and then we shall apply the steady flow ~3205~energy equation for certain engineering ~3207~devices which involve steady flow ~3210~processes so that brings us to the end ~3212~of this lecture ~3214~and ~3215~in the next lecture we shall take up ~3216~first law for open systems
