~11~Welcome to the next lecture. In this 
lecture I will be talking about mbed   ~23~C Programming Environment. I will 
introduce the mbed C programming   ~29~environment and I will show you that how you 
can actually program using this environment. ~54~As I said I will introduce the 
mbed C environment and I will   ~60~show you the steps that are required to 
create, compile and run the programs. ~68~Firstly, what is Mbed C? It is an embedded 
software development platform using which users   ~80~can develop software using C, with microcontroller 
board specific library. The program is compiled   ~92~and downloaded onto the development boards. We 
shall explain the platform using the example   ~103~of STM32F401 Nucleo ARM Development Board. For 
using this particular board you need to register,   ~124~and you have to also check certain 
functionalities which are there, etc. ~140~The first requirement is that you 
need to have this board in place and   ~147~the driver installed. You also required the 
USB-mini to USB-typeB connector. You will be   ~163~connecting this part here and this will be 
connected to your PC or laptop. This is the   ~179~first thing you need to do. And as I had 
said for development environment we will   ~187~be using an online complier that is mbed. 
So, you need to create an account in mbed. ~197~Now, how to start? During the demonstration later 
in this course we will use the online complier   ~213~that is present in http://developer.mbed.org to 
compile our projects. We can write our program   ~228~in C or python, but most specifically we will 
be writing in C. The STM32 driver must first   ~237~be installed on the desktop or laptop, then 
we will demonstrate the software development   ~243~using this. Please remember that you need the 
USB cable, you need to go here where you will   ~252~have your online complier and you have to also 
make sure that the STM driver is installed. ~265~Installation of the STM driver is fairly 
straightforward. All you need to do is   ~274~that you need to go this particular URL, 
you need to download this, and then you   ~290~have to provide some basic details. Then the 
driver will be downloaded as a zip bundle,   ~303~extract the downloaded zip file and install 
this particular file for 32-bit machine,   ~312~or if it is 64-bit machine then download this one.
This is an important step; prior to using this   ~325~particular device that you need 
to install the drivers properly. ~335~Next checking the installation; once 
it is already done connect this STM32   ~349~kit to the desktop or laptop. Go to 
device manager and check the port   ~369~number. Once the diver is correctly 
installed this will be shown there. ~400~Now, what are the steps to be followed? First 
step is you have to go to developer.embed.org ~414~Then you see that there is a place 
for user name and password; of course,   ~424~you have to first signup to do this. This 
is a simple process that you have to follow. ~441~Once you login, put up your details. 
You will have a screen like this where   ~452~you will find something which is written 
called compiler; click on that complier. ~460~And then you move on. Once you click 
on Complier for the first time,   ~471~those who are doing will come across this problem 
where you will see that it is written No Device   ~478~Selected. Either it is STMF401RE or another 
device. Then you have to select that device. ~492~The next step you have to follow 
is: you click on Add Board. ~510~And then you select NucleoF401RE; this 
is the board that we are using. So,   ~529~whatever board you are using you 
have to select that particular board. ~536~We select that board and then we move on. And 
once you do that you will see here that this   ~547~particular board got selected, earlier 
it was showing no device selected. Now,   ~552~once you do the following steps you 
will see that NucleoF401RE is selected.  ~559~Let us move on; once you see this particular 
screen you will also see my programs and you   ~570~see that it is almost empty, but if you keep 
on writing the programs it will show up. Once   ~577~I show you from my account you will see that 
there are many programs that are written here. ~583~Next step is to create a new program 
under ‘my programs’ in the project slide   ~595~bar to the left of the workspace 
by right clicking on MyPrograms,   ~601~then you create a new one and name the program and 
choose an empty template and then you press ok.  ~614~These are the steps that need to be followed 
up once you start writing the first program.   ~620~Now what you have to do? You have to add the 
cpp file by right clicking on your program   ~629~and then add a new filename. I will take it to 
this tool after just finishing few more slides. ~651~So, this is where this is 
your main.cpp is. When you   ~658~click here you see this is the main.cpp program. ~676~And then you have to compile the program. 
The compile button is shown here at the top;   ~695~you click on the compile button and then it will 
compile. Once you compile then the code will get   ~705~downloaded, save it in the Download folder.
The program starts running and the LED starts   ~716~blinking on the board. This sequence 
of steps has to be followed for any   ~721~application development. The board selection and 
the driver selection have to be done only once. ~751~You see this is the environment; this 
is the simple program that I am showing.   ~791~So, what we are doing the first step 
that is required is as I told you. ~797~This is my program you have to 
right click here on main program. ~803~And then you see that something 
like this will come up, and you   ~809~have to give a name to this program, 
let us say blinkLED and I click ok. ~825~Once I do this you double click on this 
name, and you see some sample code. We   ~834~will just cut out this sample code and 
we will be writing our code in here. ~856~I click here; this is main.cpp as I told 
you. I will save this. This is #include   ~870~mbed.h -- this is the header file that 
you need to include. Then the next thing   ~878~that you are doing is DigitalOut myLED 
(LED3), this is one of the output pins.   ~897~And the name of the LED in that STM board is 
LED3. The program is continuously running.  ~940~So, this is a simple code that I have written. We 
will be looking into more details in next slide.  ~952~Now, I will use this compile button 
to compile it, now the code is getting   ~958~compiled you can see and I have told you 
that, it will get saved in Download folder. ~967~You copy it or you can cut it from here, and you 
can see in the left side is the board which is   ~1000~mounted on the PC; you go here and you paste it.
If we do something like this the on-board led   ~1014~will start glowing.
Thank you.
